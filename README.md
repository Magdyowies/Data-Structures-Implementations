# Data Structures Course

This repository contains the code implementations of various data structures that I have learned as part of my **Data Structures** course. Each data structure is implemented in C++ and includes a description of its functionality.

## Repository Structure

- **Queue/**: Contains the implementation of a queue data structure.
- **Stack/**: Contains the implementation of a stack data structure.
- **LinkedList/**: Contains the implementation of a singly linked list.
- **Trees/**: Includes the implementation of binary trees and related operations.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Magdyowies/Data-Structures-Course.git
